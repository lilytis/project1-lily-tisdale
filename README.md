What are at least 2 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?

I had to install the requests library and the dotenv in order to compile anything in the terminal.

This is what I did to fix it:
python -m pip install requests
install python-dotenv


What are at least 2 known problems (still existing), if any, with your project? (If none, what 
are two things you would improve about your project if given more time?)

Two known problems I have are that I cannot get fly.io to launch & develop my app, but the main issue with that was that the requirements.txt would not download.
